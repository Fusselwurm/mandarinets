# Knowledge Level Assumptions
Mandarine is a Typescript & [Deno](https://deno.land) framework. We will assume you have a basic understanding of both Javascript & Typescript, but most importantly, of _Deno_.
**If you don't feel very confident, we recommend going through [a Javascript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) as well as [a Typescript tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)** which will provide you with some basic concepts you will be constantly using when creating a _Mandarine-powered application_.  

If you don't feel confident about _Deno_ and how to use it, we recommend you going through [Deno's official manual](https://deno.land/manual).

If after checking out the mentioned tutorials above, you still feel confused, we recommend you to stop here and get a higher level of understanding about Deno, Typescript & Javascript.
