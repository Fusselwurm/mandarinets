# Lifecycle

Mandarine's lifecycle refers to all process that is executed during Mandarine Compile Time (MCT) & the initialization of your application.

The responsible cores for bootstrapping a Mandarine-powered application are: **Core** & **MVC**. The rest of the cores such as **Data** and **Security** are called indirectly.
