# Introduction

Mandarine (Also known as _MandarineTS_) is a framework for building complex & reliable server-side applications. Mandarine uses [Deno](https://deno.land) as its platform thus offering the Deno community a scalable solution for many business requirements.  

Under the hood, Mandarine uses [Oak](https://oakserver.github.io/oak/) as its main HTTP dispatcher, although, Mandarine's own technology is combined and adapted to Oak in order to create a better outcome when handling requests.

## Documentation
> Deno >= v1.3.2 & Mandarine >= 2.0.0 is required for this documentation. Lower versions may result in failure. <br> Legacy documentation can be found [here](https://mandarineframework.gitbook.io/mandarine-ts/)

## Philosophy
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) has made Javascript become the new thing in the last years, however, we believe Deno can satisfy many business needs in better ways (_programmatically speaking_).  
Deno and its strong relation with modern solutions such as [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) bring better techniques in terms of coding & application performance which has a direct impact on Mandarine's mission as we strongly support these two communities since they offer robust approaches to different problems for both front-end & back-end development.

## Mission
Over the last years, we have experienced the fact that Javascript can be used to solve almost any kind of problem in one way or the other. Although, the problem of **Architecture** keeps being a hot topic of discussion. This is where Mandarine comes in, as Mandarine aims to provide a range of built-in solutions.

Mandarine is divided in 4 cores: _Core_, _MVC_, _Data_, _Security_. These 4 cores perform a different functionality to cover any kind of need such as dealing with databases or security concerns, this way, you do not have to code your own infrastructure as Mandarine offers one ready to be used.

## Mandarine & Typescript
Mandarine strongly believes in the benefits of object-oriented programming _(OOP)_ & the future of Typescript, which makes us support it all the way.
